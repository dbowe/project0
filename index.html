	<h1>From CS Major to Church Organist</h1>
	<p>
	  After majoring in Computer Science back when there was only
	  one CS major, I left the field to raise children and
	  accidently became a church musician.  I'm taking this course
	  to acquaint myself with some of the tech tools that I missed
	  while detouring but I still spend much of my time practicing
	  and performing music.
	  </p>
	<p>
	  I'm currently working on my fourth instrument, having
	  studied the other three for at least 5 years.  These
	  instruments are:
	  </p>
	  <ol>
	    <li><a href="piano.html">Piano</a></li>
	    <li><a href="clarinet.html">Clarinet</a></li>
	    <li id="repeat"><a href="piano.html">Piano</a></li>
	    <li><a href="organ.html">Pipe Organ</a></li>
	    <li>Guitar (electric & acoustic)</li>
	  </ol> 
	  <p>
	   Yes, piano is on the list twice because I've taken lessons
	   at two diffent points in my life.
