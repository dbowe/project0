	<h1>My First and Third Instrument: The Piano</h1>
	I first studied piano as a young child for the usual reason:
	my mother made me, taking lessons from my great aunt Bertha.
	My grandfather had worked as a piano technician and the family
	owned two pianos made by Vose Piano.  Bertha had both of these
	pianos, allowing us to grow up playing not only duets but
	duets of four hands on two pianos and sometimes even eight
	hands on two pianos!.
	<p>
	  After 5 years of piano, I switched
	  to <a href="clarinet.html">the clarinet</a> for the
	  remainder of my school years, but following college I became
	  interested in piano again and signed up for 4 more years of
	  lessons, this time from Gregory Slowik through the Longy
	  School of Music.
