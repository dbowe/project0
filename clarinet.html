	<h1>My Second Instrument: The Clarinet</h1>
	I picked up the clarinet as a fifth grade student in the
	Waltham Public Schools.  After two years of group lessons, I
	studied with William Cabral and Anthony Fulginetti over the
	remainder of my years in the Waltham Schools.  
	<p>
	  My clarinet playing is limited these days as I don't have
	  the time or interest in maintaining an embrochure, but I
	  yearly participated in the Parent Teacher Student (PTS) band
	  sponsored by the Belmont Schools.  Several years ago I
	  participated in On Stage at Symphony, a program sponsored by
	  the Boston Symphony Orchestra whereby amateur musicians in
	  the local area rehearse and perform a concert on the stage
	  at Symphony Hall.  The above photo was taken as a publicity
	  for that event.
